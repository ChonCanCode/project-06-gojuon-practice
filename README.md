**project-06-gojuon-practice**

***Version 1.0***
- The basic functional JS:
    1. Able to randomise different character with Math.random()
    2. Able to record the random number and enable future usage
    3. Matching the same random number gereanted with a character sound
    4. A checking function and repeatable practice

***Version 1.1***
- Bug, if space was entered in the input answer will always false
- Roadmap
    1. Create a scoped .createElement("h2") to store the charater that was tested with result
    2. Storing the result accordingly with .insertAdjacentElement("beforeend", h2)
    3. Make the character already tested will not be repeated in a singe sequence
    4. **diffcult** Create a table match with the natual gojuon template and each character that was tested will be highlighted from "style display: hidden" > " active".
